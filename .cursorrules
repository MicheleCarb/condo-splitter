## Cursor Rules

- Always read memory-bank core files at session start; create/update them if missing.
- Favor mobile-first UI with large tap targets and high contrast for elderly users.
- Keep distribution logic in pure functions to simplify Jest testing.
- Use Italian currency formatting for display but accept both `.` and `,` as decimal separators on input.
- Avoid destructive admin edits: gate millesimal changes behind confirmation and keep parent flow one-tap.
